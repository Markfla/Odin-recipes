        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish renowned for its layers of rich flavors and hearty ingredients. This beloved casserole features alternating layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, a robust meat sauce (ragù), creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese, typically mozzarella and Parmesan. The meat sauce, often made with a mix of ground beef and pork, is simmered with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and aromatic herbs, infusing the dish with a deep, savory taste.

Originating from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, lasagna showcases the region's culinary tradition of combining simple, high-quality ingredients to create a comforting and satisfying meal. Each slice offers a perfect medley of textures—tender pasta, rich meat sauce, smooth béchamel, and gooey cheese. Whether served as a centerpiece for a family gathering or a special occasion, lasagna remains a timeless favorite, loved for its comforting, layered goodness.
